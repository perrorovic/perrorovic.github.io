          <p><span class="cyan">post-01:</span> <span class="white">leaving social media</span></p>
          <p>i dont want to leave, but i have to. social media is like a life collection in my opinion, where you can share your life moment with others, thus this is the reason i never delete anything i post on social media, as those moment exist and i dont want it to be deleted. you aren't suppose to hide for who you are nor be ashame of it</p>
          <p>so with heavy heart i would just go inactive, and probably lurking around. i just lost interest, social media feels less like connection it used to be where people are there, and social element actually exist. now it is more like noise, platform for conflict, misinformation, brain-dead content and shit that is draining just to look at</p>

          <p><span class="green">post-02:</span> <span class="white">embracing linux</span></p>
          <p>i am on windows 10 for the longest time, and i enjoy my environment as this is the only os that i use daily. but every good thing has to end don't they? so windows 11 are out and windows 10 going into eol, i dont want to be on microsoft eol life-support and my current system cannot upgrade to windows 11 as it demanded some cpu features that i didn't have, so what now?</p>
          <p>instead of upgrading my system as it work perfectly fine for me, i just switched to linux head on, without any proper knowledge and install arch hyprland, with intel cpu and nvidia gpu, so you can imagine how much trouble and shit happen on this occasion</p>
          <p>in the first week of learning, i probably reinstall the os maybe like 4x and stuff always break, starting with grub, firmware, auth, polkit, keyring and such. and on the second week i get the hang of it and was familiar enough to start configure my hyprland setup keybinding and start doing normal stuff with the system</p>
          <p>now its been 214 days on arch with hyprland on my current system, and i never look back anymore</p>

          <p><span class="lavender">post-03:</span> <span class="white">beneath the abstractions</span></p>
          <p>i feel disconnected from how things actually run since we all being abstracted away from the actual thing, the moment i go into linux and unknowingly adapt the philosophy i always feel i want to get one layer closer into how things are being executed, how does this run? how does that happen? </p>
          <p> i wanted to know it, i want to study it. not because i have use for it, it is just a curiosity. so i decided to learn vulkan to get better understanding on how things are being rendered and presented, and i am happy i could use c/c++ as i been longing for this, hope i won't suffer and stumble around much, this is the <a href="https://github.com/perrorovic/vulkan-triangle">github repository</a> where i will share my journey on this</p>

          <p><span class="orange">post-04:</span> <span class="white">effect of songs</span></p>
          <p>honestly i love music, i even know how to play instrument. but i cannot listen song as casually anymore, i know song have meaning and therefore i want to perserve those for the proper time.</p>
          <p>fuck, i cannot even listen to some paticular song anymore without ruining myself, those playlist that i painstakely arrange myself, yeah those won't be played anytime soon, not in a months not in years or maybe never, it just drain my emotion too much to listen to them. i just hate how music could hold memory..</p>
          <p>i fucking hate it, is this a curse for me? or am i just unaware of this effect?</p>
          <p>anyway, this is my favourite artist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2xvldSfqY7pk8Z0DWyCYyL?si=aUkDzAnJSMK2YornZGzVKg">kaiyko</a>, i love her voice, there is some feel of pain, sadness, rememberance and joy in the same time echoes in her voice, i wish i am able to listen to her sometimes in the future..</p>
