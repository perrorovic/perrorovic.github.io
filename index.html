          <p><span class="cyan">post-01:</span> <span class="white">leaving social media</span></p>
          <p>social media is like a life collection gallery imo, where you can share your life moment with others and vice-versa, this is the reason i never delete anything i post, as those moment exist and i want it to be remembered</p>
          <p>i dont want to leave, but i have to. so i will just go inactive for the time being, and probably lurking around. i lost interest in social media where it feels less like connection it used to be, and now it is more like noise, platform for conflict, misinformation, brain-dead content and shit that is just a waste of time</p>

          <p><span class="green">post-02:</span> <span class="white">embracing linux</span></p>
          <p>win10 is going eol and i cannot upgrade to win11 because my cpu missing required features for it, so instead of upgrading my system as it work perfectly fine for me, i just switched to linux head on, without any proper knowledge. and install archlinux w/ hyprland, on intel cpu and nvidia gpu, so you can imagine how much trouble and shit happen on this occasion</p>
          <p>the first week is rough, multiple reinstall, broke nearly everything. second week getting there, able to use the system properly and start configure it, now it's been 214 days on archlinux w/ hyprland on my current system, and i never look back anymore</p>

          <p><span class="lavender">post-03:</span> <span class="white">beneath the abstractions</span></p>
          <p>the moment that i go into linux and unknowingly adapt the philosophy of it, i always feel i want to know more on how things are being executed since i feel disconnected from how things actually run since we all being abstracted away from it</p>
          <p>so just out of curiosity i decided to learn vulkan to get better understanding on renderer, hope i won't suffer and stumble around much, this is <a href="https://github.com/perrorovic/vulkan-triangle">github repository</a> where i will share my journey on this</p>

          <p><span class="orange">post-04:</span> <span class="white">effect of songs</span></p>
          <p>i fucking hate it, is this a curse for me? or am i just unaware of this effect?</p>
          <p>i cannot listen to paticular songs anymore without ruining myself, those playlist that i painstakingly arrange myself, yeah those won't be played anytime soon, not in weeks, months, years or perhaps never again. it is just too much for me to bear, i hate how music could hold memories</p>
